To compile the kernel, go into the kernel source directory and call the following command as user
(never call make as root):

$ make -j8 O=build

This will start 8 threads and put the object files and kernel objects into build/.
To clean up your workspace, just delete that directory.

To compile an out of tree Linux Kernel module, call the following command:

$ make -C $KERNDIR/build  M=$MODULE_DIR
