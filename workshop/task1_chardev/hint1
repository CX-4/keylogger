Use the following struct to implement the functions:

```
const struct file_operations my_fops = {
    .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    .open = my_open,
    .read = my_read,
    .write = my_write,
    .release = my_release,
    .unlocked_ioctl = my_ioctl
};
```

Register the struct with your character device.
(See https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/master/labs/device_drivers.html)

You can trace the functions called on you device with strace.
Test the called functions with:

$ echo aaa > /dev/keylogger
$ cat /dev/keylogger
